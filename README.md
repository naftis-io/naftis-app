# Naftis

The earth compute engine


## About Naftis

Naftis is a fully decentralized container orchestration platform, that allows you to run your containerized workload on nodes around the world.

## Project goal

The main goal of the project is to provide a decentralized way to share computer power over to others that need that power. There are a couple of projects that aim to share computer power in a decentralized manner, but only Naftis is like distributed cloud service. Using Naftis is simple as running a container on your local Docker instance, with one difference - You're starting a container on computers around the world. 

With Naftis You can:
- expose container port to the internet,
- stream logs from the container to your log collection service,
- execute binary on container instance with an interactive console,
- select node capabilities using an easy label mechanism
